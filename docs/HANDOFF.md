# Lisna — Session Handoff

**Last updated**: 2026-06-08 (all 4 families render end-to-end; founder smoke done; #66+#79 note-gen bugs fixed; focus → TRACK 2 quality)
**Purpose**: Bring a new session up to speed in <5 min. Read top → bottom in order.
**Reader**: future-self (or another Claude). Skip what you already know.

## 1. Project at a glance

**Concept**: every spoken sound, structured on the user's own device.
See [PRD.md](PRD.md) for the locked yardstick + scenario set; this
section covers only how the current stack (v1, cloud) realises it.

The shipping surface today is a Chrome extension that produces
real-time AI-generated notes from **non-downloadable lecture videos**
at Japanese universities (Keio LMS is the primary target; YouTube also
works for fixtures + dev). The same pipeline — live audio → STT →
on-demand LLM curator → Obsidian-flavored markdown — is what the v2
desktop native + on-device build will replace, with cloud kept as
fallback (see PRD §Stack stage).

## 2. Critical state (read this before anything else)

### v2 current state (2026-06-08) — READ FIRST

The active track is the **v2 on-device desktop app** (`desktop/`), not the
v1 cloud extension. The v1 sections further down (§2 "What's working
today (2026-04-30)" onward, §3 Extension map, §4 roadmap) are **frozen v1
history** — useful background, not current work.

**Where v2 stands:**

- **End-to-end pipeline works for all 4 families.** Stop → FamilyPicker →
  `session/finalize` → on-device STT → on-device LLM (grammar-constrained)
  → structured note → renderer → NoteView. Lecture / Meeting / Interview /
  Brainstorm all have cores + renderers + IPC routing on `main`.
- **Founder smoke done** on a real 8GB MacBook Air with real models
  (Llama-3.2-1B/3B Q4_K_M + kotoba-whisper v2.0 q5_0). It surfaced 3
  note-gen **code bugs — all now fixed + merged**:
  - **#66 (`6348eb2`)** — chunked-note n_ctx overflow (silent empty/
    truncated note) + `schemaVersion` normalize + system-owned note
    metadata (the "Generated Invalid Date").
  - **#79 (`f4e916a`)** — v2 Stop flow never reset the session FSM
    (`SESSION_ACTIVE` after the first recording until app restart).
- **Code bugs are done. The remaining gap is QUALITY/PERF, not code** —
  this is **TRACK 2** (see §5 + §8). The STT↔LLM memory swap is already
  implemented (`ipc.ts` unloads STT → loads LLM; finalize `finally`
  unloads LLM), so the gap is **grammar-decode speed** + **1B output
  quality** + **STT accuracy** on 8GB. Approach: measure/eval, not guess.

**Operating model: SINGLE CONTROLLER SESSION** (adopted 2026-06-08). One
session on the `main` worktree holds merge control + drives design;
execution work is delegated to subagents in isolated worktrees. Replaces
the old parallel-human-session model that caused branch drift. Full
definition in `.claude/lanes.md`.

**⚠️ CI infra debt** (not a code bug): the `ci` workflow's Playwright
Chromium-install step hangs ~10 min on a cache miss (any lockfile change)
→ job hits `timeout-minutes: 10` → **CANCELLED on every PR**. `desktop-ci`
is a separate workflow and is the real desktop verification (build + test
+ lint via `pnpm --filter @lisna/desktop verify`). Until `ci.yml` is
fixed, desktop-only / docs-only PRs must **admin-merge** once `desktop-ci`
is green (`gh pr merge --admin`). Fix options: cache Chromium properly /
split Playwright into its own job / raise the timeout / preinstall.

**Worktrees:** only `.` (main, controller) + `.claude/worktrees/spec-docs`
(long-lived doc branch). All in-flight feature worktrees pruned 2026-06-08.

### What's working today (2026-04-30 evening)

- Audio capture, STT, transcript live captions
- On-demand curator (pause / ended / manual button → wraps to outline)
- Slide detector (1 s sampling, 18 % pixel diff, 3 s min gap)
- Slide thumbnail strip + lightbox in modal (a11y: focus trap, return focus, Esc/arrows)
- Timestamp click → video jump (cross-frame relayed for K-LMS iframe)
- 2× playback compatible (scrub guard fixed)
- Quota tiered banner (90 % warn / 100 % block) — currently `Free` plan
- Obsidian markdown export with slide attachments via .zip (fflate, dynamic import)
- Auto-download on session-ended (opt-in via Options page)
- Stop button: pauses video, runs final curate, keeps modal alive for export

### What just landed (today)

| Phase | What |
|---|---|
| A | session-curate cooldown (DB column `last_curated_at` + 30 s free / 5 s pro). DB Pool `max:5→2`. stream-slide size cap 5 MB + 500 slides/session. CORS allowlist via cdk context. Migration `003_dev_user_pro` → `scripts/grant-pro.ts`. |
| B | Deleted dead code: `NoteList`, `NoteItem`, `DownloadButton` components. App.tsx `notes` state + setNotes (7 sites). `webmBlobToWav` + `audioCtx`. `lib/llm.ts`, `lib/markdown.ts`, `lib/pdf.ts`, `handlers/session-finalize.ts` + route + Lambda. |
| C | Memory-leak / race fixes: inline-button zombie scroll listeners. Content script re-injection guard (`__SH_CONTENT_BOOTED__`). AudioCapture stale-partial-state. SlideDetector stop-race. App WS effect try/catch. onLogout state cleanup completeness. |
| D | UI polish: LiveTranscript bottom-stick auto-scroll + aria-live. Slide thumbnail onError → hide button. RefreshIndicator interval bounded to 10 min. Lightbox a11y. |
| E | Type unification: extension's `Outline` interface synced to backend's curator.ts (Phase 6 fields). |
| F | Refactors: backend `withAuth<T>` wrapper (7 handlers). judge.ts → `scripts/lib/`. App.tsx `applyEvent` unifier (SP_BROADCAST + postMessage). Lambda bundling `minify+sourceMap+externalModules:['@aws-sdk/*']`. ZodError → 400. |
| Obsidian | v0.2 manual export shipped: `.zip` with `lecture.md` + `Attachments/Study-Helper/<sess>/slide-mm-ss.jpg`. Auto-download setting. Slides rendered inline in markdown (per-section by ts range). |
| Stop redesign | 停止 click now: video pause + final curate auto-trigger + sessionId stays + isCapturing flag → ExportMenu / 📝 ノートを生成 still usable. Manual curate goes via direct callApi (bypasses dead content-script listener). |
| Slide POST fix | Was returning 500 because client omitted `url` field. Backend now wraps Zod errors as 400 in `withAuth`. |
| Chunk retry | stream-audio chunk POST retries once after 1.5 s on 5xx. Cures the ~22 % API-GW-upstream-503 rate observed in real usage. |

### What landed since (2026-05-23 → 2026-05-24)

| PR | What |
|---|---|
| #17 | **Rule system bootstrap.** `CLAUDE.md` (≤150 lines, top-20 rules) + `.claude/rules/{architecture,domain,pitfalls,testing,workflow,operations}.md` (on-demand detail) + `.claude/commands/` (8 slash commands) + `.claude/hooks/{session-start,pre-commit-check,commit-msg-check}.sh` + GHA workflows (`claude-audit`, `backlog-sync`) + `docs/REFACTOR_BACKLOG.md`. Every session auto-loads CLAUDE.md; SessionStart hook prints branch + HANDOFF date + top-3 backlog + installs git hooks. |
| #18 | **Migration 004 collision fix.** `004_processed_stripe_events.sql` → `008_…` to remove numeric clash with `004_curate_cooldown.sql`. Bookkeeping migration `009_renumber_004_stripe_bookkeeping.sql` deletes the stale `schema_migrations` row. Body now `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`. |
| #21 | **CI Dependabot env fallback.** `Web — build` step uses `${{ secrets.X \|\| 'dummy' }}` pattern so Dependabot PRs (which use a separate secrets scope) can build. Real Vercel deploys ignore Actions env. |
| #20 | **Next.js 16.2.4 → 16.2.6 security patch.** High-severity: SSRF, Proxy bypass (×3), DoS, Cache poisoning, XSS. Merged after #21 unblocked. |
| #24 / #25 | Cold-start audit closure (hooks wired via `core.hooksPath`, UTF-8 commit-msg, handler-test enforcement) + `personal/CLAUDE.md` PR-monitoring rule (use sub-agent polling, not webhooks). |
| #26 | `extension/` **frozen** — no new code work there. See `CLAUDE.md` "Scope freeze" + §8.5 below. |
| (this PR) | `.github/workflows/deploy-backend.yml` + `migrate.yml` + `monitor-backend.yml` added. Backend can now deploy + migrate + self-monitor purely from GitHub once the user completes the one-time AWS OIDC IAM setup (see `.claude/rules/operations.md` `(oidc)` and the "deploy-backend fails with AWS_DEPLOY_ROLE_ARN" runbook). |
| #32 | **Legal-pad design system on marketing surfaces.** `.pad-paper` page surface (cream + printed red margin + ruled lines), `<Postit>` yellow screenshot frame (V2-B drop-shadow, em-scaled, square / wide / portrait), `#pencil-rough` SVG filter shared at root layout (used by hero circle, marginalia arrow, pricing star), Caveat handwriting font (marginalia + post-it captions only), tokens `pencil.red` / `print.red` / `postit.*` / `fontFamily.hand`. Full spec in `.claude/rules/web-design.md`. |
| #33 | **Burgundy NavBar binding.** `#6e1e1e` solid (no gradient/staples), `LocaleSwitcher` decoupled to `text-inherit` so it stays neutral on both NavBar (dark) and auth-shell (light). Same red family as `print.red` / `pencil.red` — header is the darkest value, hierarchy: header > margin line > pencil accents. |
| (this PR) | **EN/JA/KO i18n parity.** ~60% of marketing copy was untranslated (features.privacy/notes/export/marginalia, privacyEmphasis, pricingSection, faq, ctaStrip). Filled JA + KO. Extracted hardcoded strings from `footer`, `signin/page.tsx`, `download/page.tsx`, `pricing/page.tsx`, `compare/page.tsx` into new namespaces (`footer.links`, `auth`, `downloadPage`, `pricingPage`, `comparePage`). Added `web/src/i18n/brand-vocabulary.ts` as single source of truth for never-translate tokens (Lisna, Whisper, Llama, Obsidian, competitors, ¥/$, license codes) + the value-parity / hardcoded-CJK allowlists. Legal pages: privacy/terms/refunds now have EN + JA blocks in the same file, switched via `ENGLISH_LOCALES` (`en` + `ko` → EN, `ja` → JA, per design decision pending KO legal review); tokusho stays JA-only. New: `web/scripts/check-i18n.mjs` (key parity HARD, value parity + hardcoded CJK WARN; `--strict` upgrades to FAIL), wired into pre-commit (warn) + CI (strict). New rule file `.claude/rules/i18n.md` + skill `.claude/skills/i18n-check`. CLAUDE.md gained rule 17b. |

### What landed since (2026-05-26 → 2026-05-27, v2 Phase 0 spikes, separate session track)

v2 desktop spike work on `spec/v2-note-creation-design` branch. Independent of the extension freeze (which still stands).

| Commit | What |
|---|---|
| (multiple) | **Spike 0.1 zod-to-gbnf.** Iter-1..3 failed at N=10 (best 8/10, mode-A array runaway + mode-B char-escape loop). Founder selected Path 2 (retry contract). Take-4 PASSed 5/5 within ≤ 2 attempts at N=5 reduced scope. Take-5 1B Q4_K_M co-validated same retry profile (2.4× faster wall). |
| `43d1f73` | **New `(spike-llm)` pitfall rule** — pinned post-mortem of two M3-8GB kernel panics from sustained 3B Llama inference. Bans `run_in_background:true` for heavy LLM; mandates `afterAll`/`ps`/`kill -9` survivor cleanup. |
| `9eda9b1` | **Plan Amendment 1 + memo title alignment** — Plan + decision memo updated to reflect N=10→5 hardware-reduced acceptance that already shipped silently in `251c1fc` + `46ed08a`. |
| `060d1fd` | **Ultra-review fix-up (5 reviewers across 2 passes)** — Spec §7.4 also amended, `round-trip.test.ts` header rewritten, Amendment 1 expiry clause added ("STANDS until founder commit raises N"), Path 2.A/B/C concrete procedures appended to memo, take-N artifact mapping table disambiguated logs vs commits, Maxwell sample-index remap footnote added, HANDOFF §5 two new entries (Spike 0.1 N=5 envelope + Spike 0.2 latency MIXED). New `(test-headers)` pitfall rule. |
| `44e546d` | **Phase 0 verdict memo** — Spike 0.1 PASS (N=5) / 0.2 MIXED / 0.3 BLOCKED (founder JA fixtures gate) / 0.4 PASS. Plan 2 (Foundation) green-lit with 7 carry-forward items including the load-bearing retry-loop wrapper mandate. |
| `d9d333d` | **Spike 0.2 Path E per-phase timing** — empirically split the 72 s/chunk wall: prompt eval 54% @ 3.93 ms/tok, generation 43% @ 46.54 ms/tok (12× slower per token; grammar mask = dominant amplifier, ~3.1× vs no-grammar baseline). Both phases co-dominate → Path B/D de-prioritized. New Path F (1B re-spike, ~30 s/chunk estimate, lands spec) + Path G (output cap / `.max(N)` bound) as strongest single-step candidates. |
| (this commit) | **Session handoff** — 3 new `/learn` rules (dispatch trust-but-verify, dispatch send artifact ref, test-headers pair-update), decision record `2026-05-27-spike-0.1-amendment-1-n5-envelope`, REFACTOR_BACKLOG 3 new items, HANDOFF top date + §2 + §8. |

### What landed since (2026-05-28 → 2026-05-30, v2 stack reaches the app)

The v2 on-device structured note pipeline is now reachable from the app's Stop button end-to-end, with Lecture + Meeting renderers shipped.

| PR | What |
|---|---|
| #73 | **C++ grammar-constrained generation + spike-0.1 pipeline-unblock.** `GenOpts` gains `seed` + `grammar`; sampler fed both (grammar-first chain). `makeGrammarSidecar(client)` adapter on TS side. Initial real-3B gate FAILED at `runPostDecodePipeline → ZodError sections[0].heading too_small` — root cause traced to two upstream gaps, both fixed: **P0a** `zod-to-gbnf` emits `json-string-nonempty` for `.min(N>=1)` (no more grammar-valid empty strings); **P0b** orchestrator wraps per-chunk `callWithGrammar + runPostDecodePipeline` in outer 2-attempt retry on ZodError (POST_DECODE_SEED_OFFSET=10000). `common_sampler` fallback intentionally NOT taken — both samplers would have emitted the empty string. Re-gate PASS: schema-valid LectureNote, `retryAttempts/chunk:[1]`, 20.5 s wall. |
| #74 | **v2 renderer wiring — Plan 3 Tasks 11–12 + spec §9.** Stop → FamilyPicker → finalize → NoteView vertical slice. 7 commits: session/finalize IPC now returns `{noteId, note}` (was dropping note); `getCurrentSession` async + lazy LLM-load (spec §9 — unload STT, load LLM, cached per-orchestrator); preload `window.lisna.finalize`; `LectureRenderer` + slot dispatch + registerFamilyRenderer; FamilyPickerStep + NoteRenderProgress components; App.tsx FSM gains `familyPicking` + `curatingV2` states + drops dead `finalizing` view; double-click guard on 続行. |
| #75 | **Cleanup: orphaned FinalizingView + min-display.** PR #74 left FinalizingView.tsx + min-display.ts (with test) + a stale Spinner.tsx JSDoc reference. Removed per CLAUDE.md rule #9 (don't keep dead code). |
| #76 | **MeetingRenderer** — Plan 5 renderer follow-up. Mirrors LectureRenderer (pure {note}=>JSX, registerFamilyRenderer at module load). No `slotRenderers` — Meeting has no typed-extras `slots`. SpeakerRef tag hides when ref===0 (alpha runs with `diarizationStatus:'disabled'`, all refs collapse to 0). Side-effect import added in main.tsx. Caught a React gotcha in TDD — `ref` is reserved on function components; `SpeakerTag` uses `speakerRef`. New `(react-reserved-props)` pitfall rule pinned. |

### What landed since (2026-05-30 → 2026-06-08, all families render + smoke bugfixes)

| PR | What |
|---|---|
| #72 | **Interview + Brainstorm note families (Plan 6).** ai-infra cores — prompts, schemas, orchestrator wiring, hybrid cross-chunk merge (deterministic union of `qa_pairs`/participants/`ideas` + LLM-only derived prose), IPC routing (`routeInterview`/`routeBrainstorm`). |
| #78 | **Interview + Brainstorm renderers (Plan 6 Path A).** `InterviewRenderer` + `BrainstormRenderer` + the 4-family picker fully enabled. **Plan 6 fully closed** — all 4 families now have cores + renderers + IPC routing on `main`. Stop → FamilyPicker → finalize → NoteView works for every family. |
| #66 | **chunk long transcripts to prevent silent note overflow** (founder-smoke bug 1+2). Short input = byte-identical single pass; long input = silence-aware chunk → per-chunk note → lossless `【…】` merge + reactive empty-output subsplit. Also: `schemaVersion` normalized to `CURRENT_SCHEMA_VERSION` on the generation path (1B was emitting `2` via grammar → forward-incompat guard rejected ALL notes); `applyGeneratedMeta()` makes generatedAt/generatedBy/language/durationSec system-owned (1B was hallucinating an invalid `generatedAt` → "Generated Invalid Date"). |
| #79 | **reset session FSM to idle on session/finalize** (founder-smoke bug 3). v2 Stop ends at `session/finalize` and never called `session/stop`, so `current`/`recording`/`_llmLoadedForCurrent` never reset → every recording after the first rejected with `SESSION_ACTIVE` until app restart (regression from #74). Fix: `onSessionSettled` in the finalize `finally`. |
| #81 | **Review automation strengthening** — commit gate + review brief (docs+chore). |
| #77 | **HANDOFF refresh** for #73/#74/#75/#76 + the `(react-reserved-props)` pitfall rule. |

**Both #66 and #79 were admin-merged** (`gh pr merge --admin`) — `desktop-ci`
was green (real verification held); the `ci` Playwright hang would never
let them go green on their own (see CI infra debt above).

### Operational guards on GitHub (added 2026-05-24)

Runtime guards enforced by GitHub repo settings, NOT code. Canonical list +
"what to do when you hit one" lives in `.claude/rules/operations.md`. Summary:

- **Branch protection ruleset on `main`**: requires PR, `ci` + `desktop-ci` green; blocks force-push and deletion. Direct `git push origin main` rejected.
- **Auto-delete head branches** ON: PR merge removes the head branch automatically.
- **Secret scanning + push protection** ON: blocks pushes with secret-shaped strings (Stripe `sk_live_…`, AWS `AKIA…`, etc.).
- **CodeQL** ON (actions, javascript-typescript, c-cpp): passive, NOT in required-checks.
- **Dependabot** security + version updates ON: open Dependabot PRs at any time.

## 4. Roadmap (decisions made)

### v0.2 — Manual export polish ✅ DONE
- `.zip` export with sidecar slides
- Auto-download on session-ended (opt-in)
- Frontmatter (course/lecturer/date/related_lectures/tags)
- Slide attachments rewritten in markdown to local paths

### v0.3 — Obsidian REST API integration (next 1-2 months)
**Goal**: opt-in real-time vault sync. User installs Obsidian Local REST
API plugin → enters API URL + token in our Options page → modal pushes
markdown to vault as outline updates.

Implementation sketch:
- `chrome.runtime.host_permissions` add `http://127.0.0.1:27124/*` (or via optional permissions)
- Settings UI: API URL, token, vault folder, layout (single-file vs atomic notes)
- SW message `OBSIDIAN_PUSH` → PUT `/vault/{path}` with markdown
- Auto-sync toggle: push after every curate
- Manual paste / .zip download remain available alongside

### v1.0+ — Custom Obsidian plugin
Render the modal inside Obsidian as a side pane. Plugin shares JWT with
the chrome extension via storage. Most ambitious; defer until beta
feedback validates the demand.

### Anki integration (parking lot)
`check_question` → cloze deletion. Lower priority.

## 5. What's broken / monitor / open questions

| Item | State | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| 503 on stream-audio chunks | Mitigated | API-GW upstream issue. Single retry after 1.5 s in content/index.ts. CloudWatch shows clean Lambda invocations during 503. Monitor failure rate post-retry. |
| Slide POST 500 | Fixed today | Client omitted `url` field. Now sends. Backend wraps Zod errors as 400. |
| Markdown 404 | Fixed today | Stale outline state when /v1/session returns null session. App.tsx now clears `outline/slides/sessionId` in that case. |
| Anthropic SDK in SessCurateFn bundle | Known | Curator imports `@anthropic-ai/sdk` for dormant `CURATOR_PROVIDER='anthropic'` branch. Move to dynamic import when that branch goes live. |
| Curator latency on long lectures | Acceptable | 30-min content ~30-50 s, 60-min ~50-90 s. Function URL bypasses API GW 30 s limit. |
| `notes` JSONB column | Legacy, kept | Old sessions may still have data. New handlers don't write. session-get still SELECTs but UI ignores. Drop in a future migration when comfortable. |
| Stripe `apiVersion` cast | `as any` | SDK 22.1's literal type drifted to `'2026-04-22.dahlia'`. We pin `'2025-09-30.acacia'`. Update both together when the SDK upgrade is intentional. |
| Migration 004 duplicate | ✅ Fixed (PR #18, 2026-05-23) | Renumbered to 008 + bookkeeping migration 009. See `backend/src/migrations/`. |
| CI fails on Dependabot PRs | ✅ Fixed (PR #21, 2026-05-24) | `Web — build` step has `secrets.X \|\| 'dummy'` fallback. Don't strip when adding new secrets. |
| Open Dependabot PRs (2026-05-24) | Open | `dependabot/npm_and_yarn/postcss-8.5.15`, `dependabot/npm_and_yarn/vite-6.4.2`. CI should pass via the #21 fallback. |
| v2 Spike 0.1 N=5 envelope | Acknowledged (2026-05-27) | Spike 0.1 PASS at N=5 reduced scope per Plan Amendment 1 (commit `9eda9b1`). i=8 Maxwell (iter-3 mode-B string char-escape runaway) unverified — production risk covered ONLY by the retry budget. Before v2 alpha: (a) Plan 2 wrapper enforces retry contract via failing test (paper mandate today), (b) per-attempt wall-time cap 90-120 s (prevents triple-runaway 24-min UI hang), (c) UI retry counter (renderer shows "Retrying 2/3…"). Full N=10 recovery: `desktop/spikes/phase-0/01-zod-to-gbnf/decision-0.1-fail.md` "Path 2.A/B/C procedures". |
| v2 Spike 0.2 latency MIXED | Open | 3B Lecture spike PASS on Zod + slot emergence; latency 73-98 s/chunk vs spec §7.2 30 s threshold (2.5-3× over). Controller's path A-E (decision-0.2-latency.md) — recommended Path E (per-phase timings, 30 min) before A/B/C/D. Affects alpha post-Stop UX: 53-min lecture ≈ 3 min wall, 90-min ≈ 5 min wall. |
| **TRACK 2 — long-input decode latency** | Open (next) | Founder smoke saw ~5-min hangs on ~24-segment input (short/1-chunk input completes fine). NOT a memory swap (mem ~70-80%) — it's grammar-decode compute, per-chunk, × chunk count. Profile chunk count × per-chunk time. Overlaps Spike 0.2. See §8 TRACK 2. |
| **TRACK 2 — 1B output quality** | Open (next) | 1B structures the transcript weakly + hallucinates the optional `lecturer` content field (LectureRenderer ~:192, schema ~:43). 3B is the quality default (Path F: 1B Lecture FAIL) but slow/tight on 8GB. The 1B-vs-3B tradeoff is the core TRACK 2 decision. |
| **TRACK 2 — STT accuracy** | Open (separate) | kotoba-whisper v2.0 q5_0 + mic environment; accuracy low in smoke. Separate sub-track from the LLM decode/quality work. |
| CI `ci` job hangs → CANCELLED | Open (infra debt) | Playwright Chromium-install step hangs ~10 min on cache miss (any lockfile change) → `timeout-minutes: 10` → CANCELLED every PR. `desktop-ci` unaffected (separate workflow, real verify). Workaround: admin-merge on green `desktop-ci`. Fix: cache Chromium / split job / raise timeout / preinstall. |
| #80 dependabot vitest 2.1.9→4.1.0 | Open — desktop-ci FAILING | Not just the `ci` hang — `desktop-ci` is a real FAILURE. vitest 4 = the `(vitest-discovery)` `dist/**` pitfall; review carefully before merge (desktop already has a `vitest.config.ts` exclude, so this is likely a *different* vitest-4 breaking change — investigate, don't blind-merge). |

### Pending questions for the user

- After Web Store publish: lock CORS to `chrome-extension://<published-id>` via `pnpm cdk deploy -c allowedCorsOrigins=...`
- Run `scripts/grant-pro.ts <email>` on staging/prod when needed
- v0.3 spec: vault layout — single-file (default) vs atomic notes (advanced) toggle in Options

## 6. Pitfalls (battle scars to remember)

1. **Whisper segment timestamps**: chunks are 10 s clock-driven. WITHIN a chunk, Whisper segment.start can occasionally be 10.0-11.0 s due to rounding; we accept this as ±1 s noise (matters less than chunk-uniform 10 s timestamps did).

2. **Pause/scrub guards in audio-capture**: chunk advancement is wall-clock-rate, video.currentTime advance is `playbackRate × wall-clock`. Comparing the two via sample-rate math broke at 2× playback (the broken version reset every chunk → infinite loop). Current scrub guard uses `lastObservedVideoTime` jump detection (>2 s) which is playback-rate-agnostic.

3. **Cross-frame routing**: K-LMS / Vimeo / Canvas Studio embed video in a same-tab cross-origin iframe. Modal mounts in TOP frame. Capture lives in IFRAME. Coordination via `window.postMessage` with `source: 'sh-frame'` (iframe → top) and `source: 'sh-parent'` (top → iframe). Top frame relays modal-originated control messages to iframes.

4. **Content script re-injection**: SPA navigations re-run content script in same document. `__SH_CONTENT_BOOTED__` window sentinel guards listener registration. Without it MutationObservers and chrome.runtime listeners stack.

5. **API Gateway HTTP 30 s timeout is HARD**: cannot raise. The curator path uses Lambda Function URL (no API GW) to bypass. Don't accidentally put long-running handlers behind API GW.

6. **DB Pool `max:2` + transactions**: `migrate.ts` uses `pool.connect()` + same-client query for BEGIN/COMMIT. Without a single connection, pool would issue different conns per `pool.query` call → BEGIN/COMMIT on different connections → transaction effectively no-op.

7. **withAuth wrapper catches ZodError → 400**. So body validation failures don't surface as 500. New handlers should call `Body.parse()` inside the inner function (it'll throw, wrapper handles).

8. **Slides need `url` in stream-slide POST body**. Backend Zod schema requires it (same as stream-audio). Easy to forget when adding new endpoints — they share the request shape.

9. **API responses MUST set `Content-Type: application/json`** when body is JSON. Especially 4xx/5xx error paths. Frontend SW JSON-parses every response; without the header browser may treat as text/plain (not always — but inconsistent).

10. **Function URL CORS** is a separate config from the API GW CORS. Both currently `*`; lock both before publish.

## 7.5. Pre-launch state (2026-05-01)

Pre-launch checklist lives in [`docs/DEPLOYMENT.md`](./DEPLOYMENT.md).

**Software side complete**:
- Legal pages (privacy / terms / 特定商取引法) full content, ready for review
- Landing page rewritten with features + plans + privacy summary
- React ErrorBoundary, slide-detector log gating, manifest polish
- Real-time quota counter in modal header (Free plan), slide replay-dedup
- Obsidian REST API integration (settings + auto-sync + push), session history
- Inline button onboarding tooltip + pulse for first-time users

**Operator side TODO** (you must do):
1. Stripe live keys + webhook secret (currently `TEMP_PLACEHOLDER`)
2. Chrome Web Store publish + screenshots
3. CORS lockdown post-publish (`cdk deploy -c allowedCorsOrigins=...`)
4. Fill `[TODO:...]` placeholders in `web/src/app/[locale]/tokusho/page.tsx`
5. Decide support email (current: `support@study-helper.app(仮)`)

See `DEPLOYMENT.md` for the complete operator runbook.

## 8. Where to start the next session

Most likely next priorities (pick what matches user's current ask):

0. **TRACK 2 — quality / perf (CURRENT FOCUS).** All 4 families render
   end-to-end and the 3 founder-smoke code bugs are fixed (#66 + #79).
   What's left is **not code bugs** — it's whether the on-device output is
   good + fast enough on 8GB. Three open dimensions, to be prioritized by
   **measurement/eval, not guesswork** (this is what the current session
   is brainstorming):
   - **1B vs 3B (quality):** 1B structures weakly + hallucinates the
     optional `lecturer` field; 3B is the quality default but slow/tight
     on 8GB. Core tradeoff decision.
   - **Long-input decode latency:** per-chunk grammar-decode is slow on
     8GB (~5-min hangs on ~24-segment input). Grammar-decode compute, not
     memory swap. Overlaps Spike 0.2 (latency MIXED, decision-0.2). Profile
     chunk count × per-chunk time first.
   - **STT accuracy:** kotoba-whisper q5_0 + mic env; separate sub-track.

   The prioritization + measurement plan lands as a decision memo under
   `docs/superpowers/decisions/` (and/or `docs/REFACTOR_BACKLOG.md`).
   Relevant skills: `llm-eval-loop`, `api-integration-pitfalls`. Existing
   evidence: `desktop/spikes/phase-0/` (Spike 0.2 per-phase timings,
   Path E/F/G), `desktop/eval/` (Plan 7 harness — runner is a STUB).

   **Backlog mitigation still pending (alpha-gate, independent of TRACK 2):**
   - P2 wall-time cap (90–120 s per attempt) + UI retry counter — guards
     against the triple-runaway 24-min hang. Touches `callWithGrammar` +
     renderer. See `docs/REFACTOR_BACKLOG.md`.

1. **Test the today's fixes** with a real K-LMS lecture: stop button → final curate → export, slide detection multiple slide changes, .zip unpacking into Obsidian vault.

2. **v0.3 Obsidian REST API integration** — Settings UI + SW push handler + auto-sync toggle.

3. **Eval baseline regression** — `eval-curator.ts` against `v5-gpt4omini` fixture. Iterate prompt vs measured score.

4. **Session history view** — list past sessions in side-panel, click to reload outline.

5. **Chrome Web Store submission prep** — privacy policy, screenshots, description, $5 developer fee, lock CORS to published extension ID.

If user asks something specific, prioritize their request. The above is just the deferred queue.

**⚠️ Scope note (2026-05-24)**: items #1, #2, #4, #5 above all touch
`extension/`. The extension is **frozen** as of 2026-05-24 — see
§8.5 below before picking any of them up.

---

## 8.5. Scope decisions (current)

**2026-05-24 — `extension/` is FROZEN.** No new features, refactors,
or human/agent-initiated code edits inside `extension/**`. The
pipeline (audio capture → STT → curator → outline → modal) still
runs as-is; the user has shifted attention. Dependency security
patches via Dependabot continue to merge — Lisna's CI auto-builds +
tests the extension so those patches verify safely. Backend, web,
shared, infra, docs, `.claude/`, `.github/` all remain in scope.

If a future session is asked to touch `extension/`, decline and point
the requester to this section + `CLAUDE.md` "Scope freeze".

Unfreezing requires updating both `CLAUDE.md` "Scope freeze" and this
section explicitly.

---

## 9. Global memory notes

`~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` has 15+ accumulated lessons specific to this
project (Groq WebM rejection, Gemini deprecation, AWS WS IAM,
free-tier traps, per-chunk fault tolerance, TPM caps, LLM-as-judge,
self-improvement loop). Read it on session start; it has historical
context this handoff can't repeat without bloating.

---

**End of handoff.** If something material is missing, append to this
file rather than scattering notes elsewhere. Date all updates.
